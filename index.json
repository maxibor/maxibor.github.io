The Standards, Precautions, and Advances in Ancient Metagenomics community (SPAAM, https://spaam-community.org) has previously published AncientMetagenomeDir, a collection of curated and standardised sample metadata tables for metagenomic and microbial genome datasets generated from ancient samples. However, while sample-level information is useful for identifying relevant samples for inclusion in new projects, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) library construction and sequencing metadata are also essential for appropriately reprocessing ancient metagenomic data. Currently, recovering information for downloading and preparing such data is difficult when laboratory and bioinformatic metadata is heterogeneously recorded in prose-based publications. Through a series of community-based hackathon events, AncientMetagenomeDir was updated to provide standardised library-level metadata of existing and new ancient metagenomic samples. In tandem, the companion tool 'AMDirT' was developed to facilitate rapid data filtering and downloading of ancient metagenomic data, as well as improving automated metadata curation and validation for AncientMetagenomeDir. AncientMetagenomeDir was extended to include standardised metadata of over 6000 ancient metagenomic libraries. The companion tool 'AMDirT' provides both graphical- and command-line interface based access to such metadata for users from a wide range of computational backgrounds. We also report on errors with metadata reporting that appear to commonly occur during data upload and provide suggestions on how to improve the quality of data sharing by the community. Together, both standardised metadata reporting and tooling will help towards easier incorporation and reuse of public ancient metagenomic datasets into future analyses.

However, in practice, it turns out to be quite a challenging assignment to tackle, and many solutions have been proposed to address it (for a comparative benchmark, see Meyer et al. 2022).\nOne of the central aspect of taxonomic profiling is to distinguishing true positive (taxon actually present in a sample) from false positive (taxon not actually present in sample) taxonomic assignments.\nToday, I want to focus on one particular taxonomic profiler: KrakenUniq (Breitwieser et al. 2018).\nBased on the popular k-mer based taxonomic classifier Kraken (Wood et al. 2014), KrakenUniq adds a unique (😉) feature on top of Kraken, the reporting of unique k-mer counts.\nLet me explain:\nThe original Kraken program is based on direct k-mer matching. First Kraken builds a database of all present k-mer in each reference genomes, and then compares it to the k-mers found in the query sequences/sequencing reads (fig 1) . If there is a match, it uses a taxonomic tree and the LCA algorithm to assign each query sequence to a given taxon.\nFigure 1: The Kraken sequence classification algorithm. original here\nWhile this is already a good performing taxonomic profiling method, it suffers from one major drawback: it can not account for duplicated sequences. For example, when reporting the number of reads belonging to each taxon in a sample, Kraken is not able to distinguish an evenly covered genome (likely a true positive, blue genome fig 2) from a genome suffering from read stacking (likely a false positive, purple genome, fig 2). This uneven coverage, often a false positive assignment, can be the consequence of different reasons, but one of the most common is due to reads matching ultra-conserved regions between taxons from the same clade, the so-called read stacking.\nFigure 2: Two taxons having the same amount of assigned reads, two different scenarios. The blue genome has an evenly distributed coverage, while the purple genome suffers from read stacking. Unique kmers are highlighted with a black perimeter\nTo circumvent this problem, KrakenUniq leverages the HLL algorithm to count the unique/distinct k-mers. In practice, in the example of fig 2, Kraken would have reported a k-mer count of 24 for both the blue and purple genome, while KrakenUniq would have reported a k-mer count of 7 for the blue genome, and k-mer count of 2 for the purple genome.\nOn top of that, KrakenUniq keeps track of how many of unique k-mers have been found, out all possible unique k-mers for each taxon, and normalizes it by the taxon genome size, which gives an estimation of the \u0026ldquo;coverage\u0026rdquo;.\nSo, to summarize, with KrakenUniq, for each taxon, we now have three different metrics instead of \u0026ldquo;just one\u0026rdquo; for Kraken :\n read count per taxon (which we already had with kraken), we\u0026rsquo;ll refer to it later as $R$ number of unique k-mers (new with KrakenUniq), we\u0026rsquo;ll refer to it later as $K$ \u0026ldquo;coverage\u0026rdquo; of the k-mers of the clade in the database, we\u0026rsquo;ll refer to it later as $C$  Note that I\u0026rsquo;ve always mentioned the \u0026ldquo;coverage\u0026rdquo; between quotes, this is because KrakenUniq defines it as $C = \\frac{K}{genome\\ size}$.\nBecause by definition, the maximum number of k-mers (of length $k$) for a sequence of length $L$ can not exceed $L - k + 1$. This means that in the ideal situation, for example the blue genome of fig 2, the \u0026ldquo;coverage\u0026rdquo; will be at best, close to 1, but never greater than 1.\nTo try to make sense of these three metrics, Guellil et al. 2022 came up with a score $E$ combining them, to discriminate true positive from false positive taxonomic assignments.\n$$E = \\frac{K}{R} \\times C$$\nHere, using different simulated taxon assignment situations, I propose a tweak to this score, to try to improve its ability to differentiate true positive from false positive taxonomic assignments.\nThe simulations First, let\u0026rsquo;s define a few parameters for our simulation, and import necessary libraries\nimport numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns import pandas as pd read_length = 45 kmer_length = 35 genome_size = 1000000  We\u0026rsquo;ll look at four different possible scenarios\nFor each scenario, we\u0026rsquo;ll simulate 100 different situations\nscenario A: high duplication, low coverage (false positive)  A lot of reads are duplicated, probably coming from conversed regions, or sequencing artifacts low coverage There are more reads than unique k-mers  a_reads = np.random.randint(10, 300, 100) # randomly choose the number of reads, between 10 and 300 comp_kmer_a = lambda x: int(x / np.random.randint(2,10, 1)) # randomly choose between 2 and 10 times less k-mers comp_kmer_a_vec = np.vectorize(comp_kmer_a) a_kmers = comp_kmer_a_vec(a_reads) plt.plot(a_kmers/a_reads, label=r\u0026quot;$\\frac{k}{R}$\u0026quot;) plt.plot(a_kmers/genome_size, label=\u0026quot;cov\u0026quot;) plt.title(\u0026quot;scenario A\u0026quot;) plt.legend(loc=\u0026quot;upper left\u0026quot;);  scenario B: low duplication, low coverage (true positive)  Very few reads are duplicated low coverage more unique k-mers than reads (up to $ku = read_length - kmer_length + 1$ more unique k-mers than reads)  b_reads = np.random.randint(10, 300, 100) # randomly choose the number of reads, between 10 and 300 comp_kmer_b = lambda x: min(genome_size - kmer_length + 1, int(x * np.random.randint(2,(read_length - kmer_length + 1), 1))) # randomly choose up to ku more k-mers than reads comp_kmer_b_vec = np.vectorize(comp_kmer_b) b_kmers = comp_kmer_b_vec(b_reads) plt.plot(b_kmers/b_reads, label=r\u0026quot;$\\frac{k}{R}$\u0026quot;) plt.plot(b_kmers/genome_size, label=\u0026quot;cov\u0026quot;) plt.title(\u0026quot;scenario B\u0026quot;) plt.legend(loc=\u0026quot;upper left\u0026quot;);  scenario C: low duplication, higher coverage (true positive)  same as scenario B, but with a higher coverage  c_reads = np.random.randint(10000, 100000, 100) # # randomly choose the number of reads, between 10000 and 100000 comp_kmer_c = lambda x: min(genome_size - kmer_length + 1, int(x * np.random.randint(2,(read_length - kmer_length + 1), 1))) comp_kmer_c_vec = np.vectorize(comp_kmer_c) c_kmers = comp_kmer_c_vec(c_reads) plt.plot(c_kmers/c_reads, label=r\u0026quot;$\\frac{k}{R}$\u0026quot;) plt.plot(c_kmers/genome_size, label=\u0026quot;cov\u0026quot;) plt.title(\u0026quot;scenario C\u0026quot;) plt.legend(loc=\u0026quot;upper left\u0026quot;);  scenario D: low duplication, high coverage  more reads than unique kmers (because of the coverage definiton of KrakenUniq) high coverage  d_reads = np.random.randint(genome_size*1.1, genome_size*3, 100) # getting between 1.1*genome_size and 3*genome size reads comp_kmer_d = lambda x: min(genome_size - kmer_length + 1, int(x * np.random.randint(2,(read_length - kmer_length + 1), 1))) comp_kmer_d_vec = np.vectorize(comp_kmer_d) d_kmers = comp_kmer_d_vec(d_reads) plt.plot(d_kmers/d_reads, label=r\u0026quot;$\\frac{k}{R}$\u0026quot;) plt.plot(d_kmers/genome_size, label=\u0026quot;cov\u0026quot;) plt.title(\u0026quot;scenario D\u0026quot;) plt.legend(loc=\u0026quot;upper left\u0026quot;);  Comparing E-scores Guellil et al. E-score Now that we have our four different scenarios, let\u0026rsquo;s look at how Guellil et al.

Applying this technique to metagenomic data derived from archaeological remains, such as paleofeces and dental calculus, we can investigate past microbiome functional diversity that may be absent or underrepresented in the modern microbiome gene catalogue. However, compared to modern samples, ancient samples are often burdened with environmental contamination, resulting in metagenomic datasets that represent mixtures of ancient and modern DNA. The ability to rapidly and reliably establish the authenticity and integrity of ancient samples is essential for ancient DNA studies, and the ability to distinguish between ancient and modern sequences is particularly important for ancient microbiome studies. Characteristic patterns of ancient DNA damage, namely DNA fragmentation and cytosine deamination (observed as C-to-T transitions) are typically used to authenticate ancient samples and sequences, but existing tools for inspecting and filtering aDNA damage either compute it at the read level, which leads to high data loss and lower quality when used in combination with de novo assembly, or require manual inspection, which is impractical for ancient assemblies that typically contain tens to hundreds of thousands of contigs. To address these challenges, we designed PyDamage, a robust, automated approach for aDNA damage estimation and authentication of de novo assembled aDNA. PyDamage uses a likelihood ratio based approach to discriminate between truly ancient contigs and contigs originating from modern contamination. We test PyDamage on both on simulated aDNA data and archaeological paleofeces, and we demonstrate its ability to reliably and automatically identify contigs bearing DNA damage characteristic of aDNA. Coupled with aDNA de novo assembly, Pydamage opens up new doors to explore functional diversity in ancient metagenomic datasets.","tags":[],"title":"PyDamage: automated ancient damage identification and estimation for contigs in ancient DNA de novo assembly","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marsha C.

However, relatively little is known about the composition of pre-industrial gut microbiomes. Here we performed a large-scale de novo assembly of microbial genomes from palaeofaeces. From eight authenticated human palaeofaeces samples (1,000–2,000 years old) with well-preserved DNA from southwestern USA and Mexico, we reconstructed 498 medium- and high-quality microbial genomes. Among the 181 genomes with the strongest evidence of being ancient and of human gut origin, 39% represent previously undescribed species-level genome bins. Tip dating suggests an approximate diversification timeline for the key human symbiont Methanobrevibacter smithii. In comparison to 789 present-day human gut microbiome samples from eight countries, the palaeofaeces samples are more similar to non-industrialized than industrialized human gut microbiomes. Functional profiling of the palaeofaeces samples reveals a markedly lower abundance of antibiotic-resistance and mucin-degrading genes, as well as enrichment of mobile genetic elements relative to industrial gut microbiomes. This study facilitates the discovery and characterization of previously undescribed gut microorganisms from ancient microbiomes and the investigation of the evolutionary history of the human gut microbiota through genome reconstruction from palaeofaeces.","tags":[],"title":"Reconstruction of ancient microbial genomes from the human gut","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James A.

For very large files, the batch can become too big for the memory of your computer, and you end up swapping like crazy !\n  When memory overflows to swap  To prevent this, we have to restrict ourselves to batches of reasonable sizes, meaning making more batches, but smaller.\nBut beware ! RocksDB storage system relies on many indivual .sst files, that RocksDB opens in parallel to make queries and store data. The larger the database, the more files are open.

Briefly, with this collaborative community effort, we aimed to regroup in one single repository, all the metadata about every single published ancient DNA metagenomics article, and turn them into FAIR scientific data.\nWe ended with large TSV (table) files regrouping a standardized set of metadata, about each ancient DNA metagenomics sample. Because these are originally archeological data, one of the information that is systematically collected is the geographical location of each sample.\nWhile static maps were already generated for the AncientMegenomeDir publication, we had the opportunity to play with interactive maps for the website of the project.\nUsually, hosting interactive elements online require some sort of backend framework (like Streamlit or Shiny) to perform the rendering, however, I wanted to have it as serverless as possible, and this is where the GeoJSON rendering function of GitHub came to the rescue.\nUsing GitHub magic, that meant that as long as I would push a GeoJSON file on GitHub, it would automatically be rendered as an interactive map, thanks to Leaflet.js.\nFrom TSV to GeoJSON The question that I was left with: How to go from a TSV table to a GeoJSON file ? Luckily for me, this is really easy to do thanks to GeoPandas.\nI only needed to make sure that there were a latitude and longitude columns in the TSV files.\n Geographic coordinate system, credit: Wikipedia  import pandas as pd import geopandas df = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;table.tsv\u0026quot;, sep=\u0026quot;\\t\u0026quot;) gdf = geopandas.GeoDataFrame(df, geometry=geopandas.points_from_xy(df.longitude, df.latitude)) gdf.to_file(\u0026quot;output.geo.json\u0026quot;, driver='GeoJSON')   Instead of pushing to GitHub at every change to check a GeoJSON rendering, you can check a GeoJSON map with the geojson.io website.\n Displaying more metadata on the map So far, I only used the map to display the latitude and longitude of each sample, but we can actually display more information by changing the color, size, or the shape of each marker(point) for example.\nRefering again the Github documentation, this corresponds to the marker-color, marker-size, or marker-symbol.\nFor example, to change the color, we add a marker-color column with the desired color value.\n   marker-color publication_doi site_name latitude longitude sample_name sample_age material archive archive_accession     #009C54 10.1016/j.quascirev.2017.11.037 Hässeldala Port 56.16 15.01 HA1.1 13900 lake sediment ENA SRS2040659   #C22026 10.3390/geosciences10070270 Unknown 53.322 1.118 ELF001A_95_S81_ELFM1D1 6000 shallow marine sediment ENA ERS3605424    Table 1: Sample data from the AncientMetagenomeDir repository\n Markers are colored by property  Here, markers in pink are host-associated single genomes, while markers in light-blue are host-associated metagenomes.\nPreventing overlapping points In this dataset, different samples are sometimes coming from a same archeological site. In practice, this means that points will overlap on the map because they share the exact same geographic coordinates. In Figure 2, for example, you can notice a very dark shadow bellow each marker: that\u0026rsquo;s because there are many overlapping markers present on the spot.\nThe problem is that only one marker will be displayed, and the other ones being hidden below.\nTo overcome this issue, the little trick is to slightly alter the coordinates of each sample to plot them as distinct points on the map. I did that with random sampling from the normal distribution using Numpy with a very small standard deviation.\nimport pandas as pd import geopandas import numpy as np df = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;table.tsv\u0026quot;, sep=\u0026quot;\\t\u0026quot;) sigma = 0.0015 df['new_latitude'] = df['latitude'].apply(lambda x: np.random.normal(x, sigma)) df['new_longitude'] = df['longitude'].apply(lambda x: np.random.normal(x, sigma)) gdf = geopandas.GeoDataFrame(df, geometry=geopandas.points_from_xy(df.new_longitude, df.new_latitude)) gdf.to_file(\u0026quot;output.geo.json\u0026quot;, driver='GeoJSON')  Problem solved !\n Overalapping markers are \u0026lsquo;jittered\u0026rsquo; around the exact coordinates  End result Finally, thanks to the magic of GitHub GeoJSON rendering, the map can be easily embedded on any web page !\n This is an interactive map, you can click around and zoom to navigate.\n","date":1610453310,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610453310,"objectID":"10d879789c08f77fbf1dbdbebe351ede","permalink":"https://maximeborry.com/post/interactive-map-howto/","publishdate":"2021-01-12T13:08:30+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/interactive-map-howto/","section":"post","summary":"Recently, I\u0026rsquo;ve been involved with the AncientMetagenomeDir project.
