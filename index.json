Within the field of ancient metagenomics, the number of published genetic datasets has risen dramatically in recent years, and tracking this data for reuse is particularly important for large-scale ecological and evolutionary studies of individual microbial taxa, microbial communities, and metagenomic assemblages. AncientMetagenomeDir (archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3980834) is a collection of indices of published genetic data deriving from ancient microbial samples that provides basic, standardised metadata and accession numbers to allow rapid data retrieval from online repositories. These collections are community-curated and span multiple sub-disciplines in order to ensure adequate breadth and consensus in metadata definitions, as well as longevity of the database. Internal guidelines and automated checks to facilitate compatibility with established sequence-read archives and term-ontologies ensure consistency and interoperability for future meta-analyses. This collection will also assist in standardising metadata reporting for future ancient metagenomic studies.","tags":[],"title":"Community-curated and standardised metadata of published ancient metagenomic samples with AncientMetagenomeDir","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James A.

In the context of this heterogeneous landscape, we present nf-core/eager, an advanced and entirely redesigned pipeline for the analysis of ancient genomic data. nf-core/eager builds on existing ideas and concepts introduced in the original EAGER pipeline, and improves various aspects of the analysis procedure by employing computational frameworks such as Nextfow and nf-core. The pipeline aims to address three main themes: accessibility and adaptability to different research groups and their computing configurations, reproducibility to ensure robust analytical standards in the field, and updating the EAGER pipeline to the latest routine ancient genomic practises. This new version of EAGER has been developed within the nf-core initiative, to ensure high quality software development and maintenance support; contributing to a long-term lifecycle for the pipeline. nf-core/eager will assist in ensuring that ancient DNA sequencing data can be used by a diverse range of research groups and fields.textless/ptextgreater","tags":null,"title":"Reproducible, portable, and efficient ancient genome reconstruction with nf-core/eager","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maxime Borry et al"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585699200,"objectID":"a6c841878089f7ea449b41187a425d5b","permalink":"/publication/borry-coproid-2020/","publishdate":"2020-05-04T10:05:30.663951Z","relpermalink":"/publication/borry-coproid-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Shotgun metagenomics applied to archaeological feces (paleofeces) can bring new insights into the composition and functions of human and animal gut microbiota from the past. However, paleofeces often undergo physical distortions in archaeological sediments, making their source species difficult to identify on the basis of fecal morphology or microscopic features alone. Here we present a reproducible and scalable pipeline using both host and microbial DNA to infer the host source of fecal material. We apply this pipeline to newly sequenced archaeological specimens and show that we are able to distinguish morphologically similar human and canine paleofeces, as well as non-fecal sediments, from a range of archaeological contexts.","tags":null,"title":"CoproID predicts the source of coprolites and paleofeces using microbiome composition and host DNA content","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1578047467,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578047467,"objectID":"ef1f1688bdc9cf908c3f39b559c69174","permalink":"/project/cogsea/","publishdate":"2020-01-03T11:31:07+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/cogsea/","section":"project","summary":"comparative Analysis of Gene Set Enrichment analysis.
