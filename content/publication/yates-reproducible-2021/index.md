abstract: 'The broadening utilisation of ancient DNA to address archaeological, palaeontological,
  and biological questions is resulting in a rising diversity in the size of laboratories
  and scale of analyses being performed. In the context of this heterogeneous landscape,
  we present an advanced, and entirely redesigned and extended version of the EAGER
  pipeline for the analysis of ancient genomic data. This Nextflow pipeline aims to
  address three main themes: accessibility and adaptability to different computing
  configurations, reproducibility to ensure robust analytical standards, and updating
  the pipeline to the latest routine ancient genomic practices. The new version of
  EAGER has been developed within the nf-core initiative to ensure high-quality software
  development and maintenance support; contributing to a long-term life-cycle for
  the pipeline. nf-core/eager will assist in ensuring that a wider range of ancient
  DNA analyses can be applied by a diverse range of research groups and fields.'
