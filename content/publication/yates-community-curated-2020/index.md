abstract: Ancient DNA and RNA are valuable data sources for a
  wide range of disciplines. Within the field of ancient metagenomics, the number
  of published genetic datasets has risen dramatically in recent years, and tracking
  this data for reuse is particularly important for large-scale ecological and evolutionary
  studies of individual microbial taxa, microbial communities, and metagenomic assemblages.
  AncientMetagenomeDir (archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3980834) is a collection
  of indices of published genetic data deriving from ancient microbial samples that
  provides basic, standardised metadata and accession numbers to allow rapid data
  retrieval from online repositories. These collections are community-curated and
  span multiple sub-disciplines in order to ensure adequate breadth and consensus
  in metadata definitions, as well as longevity of the database. Internal guidelines
  and automated checks to facilitate compatibility with established sequence-read
  archives and term-ontologies ensure consistency and interoperability for future
  meta-analyses. This collection will also assist in standardising metadata reporting
  for future ancient metagenomic studies.
