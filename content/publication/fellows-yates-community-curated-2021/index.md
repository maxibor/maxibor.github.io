abstract: Ancient DNA and RNA are valuable data sources for a wide range of disciplines.
  Within the field of ancient metagenomics, the number of published genetic datasets
  has risen dramatically in recent years, and tracking this data for reuse is particularly
  important for large-scale ecological and evolutionary studies of individual taxa
  and communities of both microbes and eukaryotes. AncientMetagenomeDir is a collection of annotated metagenomic
  sample lists derived from published studies that provide basic, standardised metadata
  and accession numbers to allow rapid data retrieval from online repositories. These
  tables are community-curated and span multiple sub-disciplines to ensure adequate
  breadth and consensus in metadata definitions, as well as longevity of the database.
  Internal guidelines and automated checks facilitate compatibility with established
  sequence-read archives and term-ontologies, and ensure consistency and interoperability
  for future meta-analyses. This collection will also assist in standardising metadata
  reporting for future ancient metagenomic studies.
