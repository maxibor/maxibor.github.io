Introduction to Ancient Metagenomics textbook: [spaam-community.org/intro-to-ancient-metagenomics-book](https://www.spaam-community.org/intro-to-ancient-metagenomics-book/)

> "Focusing on host-associated ancient metagenomics, readers will learn the main steps of ancient metagenomic bioinformatic workflows, become familiar with the command line, learn how to process next-generation-sequencing (NGS) data, conduct taxonomic profiling of datasets, carry out ecological analyses, and perform de novo metagenomic assembly. By the end of the textbook, readers will have an understanding of how to effectively carry out the major bioinformatic components of an ancient metagenomic project in an open, reliable, and reproducible manner"
