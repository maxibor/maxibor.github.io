I am Maxime, a Bioinformatics scientist specializing in the development of statistical tools and workflows for the analysis of omics data. I have extensive experience working with prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and human systems, and I excel at transforming complex biological datasets into scientific results through rigorous approaches and scalable bioinformatics solutions.

After an undergraduate degree in biology, I initially pursued studies in population and environmental sciences. After realizing I wanted to focus more on statistics and data analysis, I returned to complete an M.Sc. in Bioinformatics.

I completed my PhD in the [Microbiome Sciences research group at the MPI-EVA](https://www.eva.mpg.de/archaeogenetics/research-groups/microbiome-sciences/), studying ancient DNA metagenomics, and continued this work as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Leibniz-HKI](https://www.leibniz-hki.de/en/) with a focus on fermentation microbiomes. Recently, I transitioned to computational oncology and cancer research, focusing on personalized cancer vaccine development and the analysis of cancer genomics datasets.
