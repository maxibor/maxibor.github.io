I am __Maxime__, a __Doctoral Researcher in Bioinformatics__ at the [__Max Planck Institute for the Science History__](https://shh.mpg.de/en), and the [__Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology__](https://www.eva.mpg.de/index/) in Germany.

After an undergraduate degree in biology, I first decided to dive in the studies of population and our environment. Only after realizing I wanted to focus more on the statistical part and the data analysis, I switched back to a Bioinformatics MSc. 

I am now working in the [Microbiome Sciences research group](https://www.shh.mpg.de/118825/dag_research_groups) on ancient DNA metagenomics, under the supervision of [Christina Warinner](http://christinawarinner.com).
