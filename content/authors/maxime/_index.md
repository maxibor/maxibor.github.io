I am __Maxime__, a __Postdoctoral Researcher in Bioinformatics__ at the [__Leibniz Institut for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology Hans Knöll Institute__](https://www.leibniz-hki.de/en/), and the [__Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology__](https://www.eva.mpg.de/index/) in Germany.

After an undergraduate degree in biology, I first decided to dive in the studies of population and our environment. Only after realizing I wanted to focus more on the statistical part and the data analysis, I switched back to a Bioinformatics MSc.

I did my PhD in the [Microbiome Sciences research group](https://www.shh.mpg.de/118825/dag_research_groups) on ancient DNA metagenomics, under the supervision of [Christina Warinner](http://christinawarinner.com). I now continue this work as a postdoctoral researcher, focusing more in depth on fermentation microbiomes.
