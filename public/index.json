Briefly, with this collaborative community effort, we aimed to regroup in one single repository, all the metadata about every single published ancient DNA metagenomics article, and make them FAIR.\nWe ended with large TSV table files regrouping a standardized set of metadata, about each ancient DNA metagenomics sample. Because these are originally archeological data, one the information that is systematically collected is the geographical location of each sample.\nWhile static maps were already generated for the AncientMegenomeDir publication, we had the opportunity to play with interactive maps for the website of the project.\nUsually, hosting interactive elements online require some sort of a backend framework (like Streamlit or Shiny) to perform the rendering, however, I wanted to have it as serverless as possible, and this is where the GeoJSON rendering function of GitHub came to the rescue.\nThat meant that as long as I would push a GeoJSON file on GitHub, it would automatically be rendered as an interactive map by GitHub, thanks to Leaflet.js.\nFrom TSV to GeoJSON The question that I was left with: How to go from a TSV table to a GeoJSON file. Luckily for me, this is really easy to do thanks to GeoPandas.\nThe only things I need were to make sure there were a latitude and longitude column.\n A caption     test   import pandas as pd import geopandas df = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;table.tsv\u0026quot;, sep=\u0026quot;\\t\u0026quot;) gdf = geopandas.GeoDataFrame(df, geometry=geopandas.points_from_xy(df.longitude, df.latitude)) gdf.to_file(\u0026quot;output.geo.json\u0026quot;, driver='GeoJSON')   Instead of pushing to GitHub at every change to check the GeoJSON rendering, we can check our GeoJSON map with the geojson.io website.\n Displaying more metadata on the map So far, I only used the map to display the latitude and longitude of each sample, but we can actually display more information by changing the color, size, or the shape of each marker(point) for example.\nRefering again the Github documentation, this corresponds to the marker-color, marker-size, or marker-symbol.\nThe only thing that we have to do, is add as column with the property name and the desired values (here marker-color)\n   marker-color publication_doi site_name latitude longitude sample_name sample_age material archive archive_accession     #009C54 10.1016/j.quascirev.2017.11.037 Hässeldala Port 56.16 15.01 HA1.1 13900 lake sediment ENA SRS2040659   #C22026 10.3390/geosciences10070270 Unknown 53.322 1.118 ELF001A_95_S81_ELFM1D1 6000 shallow marine sediment ENA ERS3605424      test   Here, markers in pink are host-associated single genomes, while markers in green are environmental metagenomes.\nPreventing overlapping points As in this dataset, there are different samples coming from the sample archeological sites, it meant that I had to deal with exactly overlapping points because they share the exact same geographic coordinates.\nThis is problematic for the map, because only one will be displayed, the other ones being hidden below.\nTo overcome this issue, there is the clever little trick of slightly altering the coordinates of each sample to plot them as distinct points on the map. I do that with random sampling from the normal distribution using numpy with a very small standard deviation.\nimport pandas as pd import geopandas import numpy as np df = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;table.tsv\u0026quot;, sep=\u0026quot;\\t\u0026quot;) df['new_latitude'] = df['latitude'].apply(lambda x: np.random.normal(x, sigma)) df['new_longitude'] = df['longitude'].apply(lambda x: np.random.normal(x, sigma)) gdf = geopandas.GeoDataFrame(df, geometry=geopandas.points_from_xy(df.new_longitude, df.new_latitude)) gdf.to_file(\u0026quot;output.geo.json\u0026quot;, driver='GeoJSON')  ","date":1610453310,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610453310,"objectID":"10d879789c08f77fbf1dbdbebe351ede","permalink":"/post/interactive-map-howto/","publishdate":"2021-01-12T13:08:30+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/interactive-map-howto/","section":"post","summary":"Recently, I\u0026rsquo;ve been involved with the AncientMetagenomeDir project.

Within the field of ancient metagenomics, the number of published genetic datasets has risen dramatically in recent years, and tracking this data for reuse is particularly important for large-scale ecological and evolutionary studies of individual microbial taxa, microbial communities, and metagenomic assemblages. AncientMetagenomeDir (archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3980834) is a collection of indices of published genetic data deriving from ancient microbial samples that provides basic, standardised metadata and accession numbers to allow rapid data retrieval from online repositories. These collections are community-curated and span multiple sub-disciplines in order to ensure adequate breadth and consensus in metadata definitions, as well as longevity of the database. Internal guidelines and automated checks to facilitate compatibility with established sequence-read archives and term-ontologies ensure consistency and interoperability for future meta-analyses. This collection will also assist in standardising metadata reporting for future ancient metagenomic studies.","tags":[],"title":"Community-curated and standardised metadata of published ancient metagenomic samples with AncientMetagenomeDir","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James A.

In the context of this heterogeneous landscape, we present nf-core/eager, an advanced and entirely redesigned pipeline for the analysis of ancient genomic data. nf-core/eager builds on existing ideas and concepts introduced in the original EAGER pipeline, and improves various aspects of the analysis procedure by employing computational frameworks such as Nextfow and nf-core. The pipeline aims to address three main themes: accessibility and adaptability to different research groups and their computing configurations, reproducibility to ensure robust analytical standards in the field, and updating the EAGER pipeline to the latest routine ancient genomic practises. This new version of EAGER has been developed within the nf-core initiative, to ensure high quality software development and maintenance support; contributing to a long-term lifecycle for the pipeline. nf-core/eager will assist in ensuring that ancient DNA sequencing data can be used by a diverse range of research groups and fields.textless/ptextgreater","tags":null,"title":"Reproducible, portable, and efficient ancient genome reconstruction with nf-core/eager","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maxime Borry et al"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585699200,"objectID":"a6c841878089f7ea449b41187a425d5b","permalink":"/publication/borry-coproid-2020/","publishdate":"2020-05-04T10:05:30.663951Z","relpermalink":"/publication/borry-coproid-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Shotgun metagenomics applied to archaeological feces (paleofeces) can bring new insights into the composition and functions of human and animal gut microbiota from the past. However, paleofeces often undergo physical distortions in archaeological sediments, making their source species difficult to identify on the basis of fecal morphology or microscopic features alone. Here we present a reproducible and scalable pipeline using both host and microbial DNA to infer the host source of fecal material. We apply this pipeline to newly sequenced archaeological specimens and show that we are able to distinguish morphologically similar human and canine paleofeces, as well as non-fecal sediments, from a range of archaeological contexts.","tags":null,"title":"CoproID predicts the source of coprolites and paleofeces using microbiome composition and host DNA content","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1578047467,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578047467,"objectID":"ef1f1688bdc9cf908c3f39b559c69174","permalink":"/project/cogsea/","publishdate":"2020-01-03T11:31:07+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/cogsea/","section":"project","summary":"comparative Analysis of Gene Set Enrichment analysis.
